# Azure DevOps Search

This is a chrome extension that's designed for all those times when a coworker references a workitem by its number leaving you to look it up yourself.

## Current Functionality

### Settings
Settings are based off the URL following the format of `https://company.visualstudio.com/Project/`

### Searching
If you type in a number, it will attempt to open the work item directly.

Other searches will start a search.

In both cases a new tab will be opened.


`ALT`+`SHIFT`+`D`:  Quick open popup window for mouse-free use

## Roadmap / Future Functionality

* Support for searching (by default) non-work items
* Support for multiple Projects (tentatively planned)
* Support for multiple Companies (unplanned)
* A real icon (unplanned)
